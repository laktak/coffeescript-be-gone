# CoffeeScript Be Gone

No more CoffeeScript code in your favorite editor!

Hereâ€™s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels. The trouble makers, the round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things JavaScriptly.

This package will replace any CoffeeScript with working JavaScript code. Since the file extension is still .coffee we place the code inside backticks so the coffee compiler will just pass it through.

## Installation

```sh
apm install coffeescript-be-gone
```
or find it in the Packages tab under settings

## Usage

Open any `.coffee` file and get JavaScript instead!
